### Hack a Thing 2: Frontend

## Installation

- To install, run `yarn`
- To run the Webpack Development Server, run `yarn start`
- To build and deploy your code, run `yarn deploy`

- To run unit tests, run `yarn test`. Tests initially run `eslint` to check for proper code style before running `jest`. To automatically fix most `eslint` errors, run `eslint src/**.js --fix` in the main directory.
